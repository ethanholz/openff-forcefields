<!--
Thank you for submitting this bug report!

If your issue relates to using the OpenFF Toolkit (loading molecules or
topologies, applying force fields, using the AmberTools/RDKit/OpenEye toolkit
wrappers), compatibilities with conversions through OpenMM/ParmEd, or
installing software, please raise an issue in the OpenFF Toolkit repo:

https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit/issues/new/choose

If your issue relates more specifically to the force fields themselves (missing
or seemingly bad parameters, force fields producing bad physics or blowing up),
please continue below.
